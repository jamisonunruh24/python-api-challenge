part 1
generate 500+ random long lat coordinates
	list for both long and lat, randomly generated

use citypi to find closest city and put in list

use loop to pull temp(f), Humidity(%) cloudyness(%) and windspeed(MPH) and north/south(if > 0 if < 0) hempisphere location.  (assign all to lists)
create dataframe out of lists

use matplotlib to create scatter plots using the lists
use dataframe to split into north/south for linear regression
